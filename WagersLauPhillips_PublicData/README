## Wagers, Lau, & Phillips (2009) Public Data 

This archive contains reading-time data from the six experiments reported in 

> Wagers, M., Lau, E., Phillips, C. (2009). Agreement attraction in comprehension: representations and processes. *Journal of Memory and Language, 61*, 206-237. [DOI:10.1016/j.jml.2009.04.002](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X09000448).

The data are stored in six `CSV` files, one each for the correspondingly-numbered experiment in the paper. There is also an `Rdata` file which can be opened directly in the R Environment: it contains six dataframes, named Experiment{1-6}.

The column names are exactly the variables defined by the [Linger](http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Linger/) platform (Version 2.94; Rohde, 2003). Each row corresponds to the reading time for a single region, which in these experiments always corresponded to a word (or a singly-regioned noun-noun compound like `factory_worker`). The reading-time and question-answering data have not been separately collated. If you wish to analyze question-answering accuracy, extract only the trials for Region 1 and compute over the QPCT column.

## Experiment 1: S-V agreement with no distractors

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grammaticality</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SubjectNumber</span>.

- Critical regions:
    - 3: subject head
    - 4: spill-over adverb
    - 5: number-marked auxiliary
    - 6: predicate

### Example Item Set

- Condition a :: Grammatical :: Singular subject head
    - The old key unsurprisingly was rusty from many years of disuse ...
- Condition b :: Ungrammatical :: Singular subject head
    - The old key unsurprisingly were rusty from many years of disuse ...
- Condition c :: Ungrammatical :: Plural subject head
    - The old keys unsurprisingly was rusty from many years of disuse ...
- Condition d :: Grammatical :: Plural subject head
    - The old keys unsurprisingly were rusty from many years of disuse ...
    

## Experiment 2: Agreement in relative clauses with RC Head Distractor

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grammaticality</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DistractorNumber</span>. The RC-internal subject is always singular (and thus the grammatical verb is always marked for singular).

- Critical regions:
    - 2: RC head
    - 5: Singular RC-internal subject head
    - 6: Number-marked RC-internal lexical verb
    - 7-9: Spill-over (various)

### Example Item Set

- Condition c :: Grammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The publicist who the politician uses during a crisis ... 
- Condition d :: Ungrammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The publicist who the politician use during a crisis ...
- Condition g :: Grammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The publicists who the politician use during a crisis ...
- Condition h :: Ungrammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The publicists who the politician use during a crisis ...


## Experiment 3: Agreement in relative clauses with RC Head Distractor

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grammaticality</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DistractorNumber</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SubjectNumber</span>. Conditions {c, d, g, h} from Experiment 2 become Conditions {a, b, e, f} in Experiment 3. Conditions {c, d, g, h} below represent the Plural level of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">SubjectNumber</span>.
 
- Critical regions:
    - 2: RC head
    - 5: Singular RC-internal subject head
    - 6: Number-marked RC-internal lexical verb
    - 7-8: Spill-over (various)

### Example Item Set

- Condition c :: Grammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The publicist who the politicians use during a crisis ... 
- Condition d :: Ungrammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The publicist who the politicians uses during a crisis ...
- Condition g :: Grammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The publicists who the politicians use during a crisis ...
- Condition h :: Ungrammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The publicists who the politicians uses during a crisis ...


## Experiment 4: Agreement in matrix clauses with In-PP-Modifier Distractor

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grammaticality</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DistractorNumber</span>.

- Critical regions:
    - 2: subject head
    - 5: distractor noun
    - 6: spill-over adjective
    - 7: number-marked auxiliary
    - 8: predicate

### Example Item Set
 
- Condition a :: Grammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The key to the cell unsurprisingly was rusty ... 
- Condition b :: Grammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The key to the cells unsurprisingly was rusty ... 
- Condition c :: Ungrammatical :: Singular distractor
    - The key to the cell unsurprisingly were rusty ... 
- Condition d :: Ungrammatical :: Plural distractor
    - The key to the cells unsurprisingly were rusty ... 

## Experiment 5: Agreement in matrix clauses with In-PP-Modifier Distractor

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grammaticality</span> &times; <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DistractorNumber</span>. Experiment 5 differs from Experiment 4 only in that the post-subject adverb was removed.

- Critical regions:
    - 2: subject head
    - 5: distractor noun
    - 6: number-marked auxiliary
    - 7: predicate
    
## Experiment 6: Agreement in matrix clauses with In-PP-Modifier Distractor

The design is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">DistractorNumber</span>: all sentences are grammatical and all that varies is whether the Within-PP modifier is singular or plural.  The items (and critical regions) are identical to Experiment 4 Conditions A and B.
